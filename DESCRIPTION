Description: This package tests for block-diagonal structure in symmetric matrices. The null hypothesis that the off-diagonal elements are exchangeable. It uses Monte Carlo resampling to estimate the permutation p-value for Hubert's Gamma and a t-statistic with unequal variance. Both overall and block-specific p-values are returned.
