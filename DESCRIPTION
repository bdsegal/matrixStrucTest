Description: This package tests for block-diagonal structure in symmetric matrices. The null hypothesis that the off-diagonal elements are exchangeable. It uses Monte Carlo resampling to estimate the permutation p-value for Hubert's Gamma and a t-statistic with unequal variance. Both overall and block-specific p-values are returned. Please see Segal, et al. (2019) <doi:10.1007/s11336-018-9647-4> for more information.
Depends: R (>= 3.1)
Suggests: ggplot2, reshape2
